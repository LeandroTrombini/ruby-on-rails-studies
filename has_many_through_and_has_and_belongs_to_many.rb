# has_many :through vs has_and_belongs_to_many in Rails

# In Rails, both has_many :through and has_and_belongs_to_many are used to set up many-to-many relationships between models.
# However, they have different use cases and implementations.

# has_and_belongs_to_many

# The has_and_belongs_to_many association sets up a direct many-to-many connection with another model, using a join table without a corresponding model.

# Example

# Let's create an example with Student and Course models where students can enroll in many courses and courses can have many students.

# Step 1: Generate Models

# $ rails generate model Student name:string
# $ rails generate model Course name:string

# Step 2: Create Join Table

# $ rails generate migration CreateJoinTableStudentsCourses students courses

# Step 3: Define Models

# app/models/student.rb
class Student < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :courses
end

# app/models/course.rb
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :students
end

# Step 4: Migrate the Database

# $ rails db:migrate

# has_many :through

# The has_many :through association sets up a many-to-many connection with another model through a third model.
# This is useful when you need to work with the relationship model as its own entity.

# Example

# Let's create an example with Doctor, Patient, and Appointment models where doctors have many patients through appointments and vice versa.

# Step 1: Generate Models

# $ rails generate model Doctor name:string
# $ rails generate model Patient name:string
# $ rails generate model Appointment doctor:references patient:references date:datetime

# Step 2: Define Models

# app/models/doctor.rb
class Doctor < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :patients, through: :appointments
end

# app/models/patient.rb
class Patient < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :doctors, through: :appointments
end

# app/models/appointment.rb
class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :doctor
  belongs_to :patient
end

# Step 3: Migrate the Database

# $ rails db:migrate

# Summary

# - has_and_belongs_to_many: Direct many-to-many connection using a join table without a corresponding model.
# - has_many :through: Many-to-many connection through a third model, useful when you need to work with the relationship model as its own entity.
