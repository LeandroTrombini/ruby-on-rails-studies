# Turbolinks in Rails

# Turbolinks is a library included in Rails that makes navigating your web application faster.
# It does this by using AJAX to load only the body and the title of new pages, instead of reloading the entire page.
# This results in faster page transitions and a more responsive user experience.

# How Turbolinks Works

# When a user clicks a link, Turbolinks intercepts the request, fetches the new page via AJAX,
# and replaces the <body> and <title> of the current page with the new content.
# This avoids the full page reload and preserves the state of JavaScript and CSS.

# Setting Up Turbolinks

# Turbolinks is included by default in new Rails applications. To ensure it's set up correctly, follow these steps:

# Step 1: Ensure Turbolinks is in Your Gemfile

# Gemfile
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'

# Run `bundle install` to install the gem.

# Step 2: Include Turbolinks in Your JavaScript

# Ensure Turbolinks is required in your JavaScript pack file.

# app/javascript/packs/application.js
import Turbolinks from "turbolinks"
Turbolinks.start()
